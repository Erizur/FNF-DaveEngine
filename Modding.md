# Compiling
Just follow a basic [compiling tutorial.](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin#build-instructions)
Instead of using Haxe 4.1.5, use the [latest Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), the issues mentioned in the guide are already fixed.

Note: Make sure you do `haxelib install hscript` before making an issue.

# Modding
Just edit the source code it's not that hard (unless you can't code)...

For the non-coding people, you can mod the characters and add your own, since the positions are not hardcoded anymore.
IF YOU WANNA MAKE YOUR OWN MODIFICATION/CUSTOM ENGINE PLEASE CREDIT THE ORIGINAL DEVS!
